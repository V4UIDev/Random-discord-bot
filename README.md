# Random-discord-bot

## ***INTRODUCTION***
Random Discord Bot is a training project that aims to bring random features to Discord.
I intend to add more features to the project as I get more competent with Javascript
and can find new ways to simplify complex problems.

## ***LANGUAGES***
-JavaScript 1.8.5

-Node.JS 14.15.4 LTS


## ***USING THE BOT***

To run/test the script, you will need:

-A Discord bot which can be created from the Discord website - https://discord.com/developers

-Node.JS - https://nodejs.org/en/download/

-Node packages:

  -Cheerio
  
  -request
 
  -Discord.js
  
Node Packages are installed using npm install packagename in command prompt e.g. npm install Discord.js

For simplicity, I recommend making a bot folder in C:\Users\username\Documents\botname.

Once you have created this file you navigate to it in the command prompt and install the node packages to this file. 

Also, place the JavaScript file in the C:\Users\username\Documents\botname folder.

Run it from the command prompt using node randombot.js once navigated to the botname folder.
  


## ***LICENSING AND COMMENTS***

The script is open source. 

I am willing to collaborate with anyone if they have a specific idea of where they want to take the bot.
